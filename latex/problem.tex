\section{Problem and Interpretation}
Read This. This setup is exceedingly nice
Unfortunately, it does not refresh as fast as I would like it to.
However, it does have many of its advantages.
For example, it is much faster than any other editor that I will ever use.
The refresh and save function is a little convoluted, but I don't have much problem with it.
