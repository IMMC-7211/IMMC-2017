In the modern world, technology creates global connections, enabling companies to have employees in all the corners of the world. However, at times physical meeting are necessary for optimal productivity. As this requires employees to congregate in one location, employees must travel vast distances, often crossing timezones. Arising problems are abnormal expenses and jet lag, which affects employees' productivity and compromises the value of these meetings. Our team attempts to solve this problem, using techniques from modeling airplane tickets prices based on distance and time of year to modeling individual neurons in employee brains. Many aspects of this problem were taken into consideration.


Our model selected Irkutsk, Russia for test scenario 1 and Astana, Kazakhstan for scenario 2.
